## Introduction

*Nazi Zombies: Portable* is build using many open source, well-documented tools as well as a boundation of already well-understood game architecture. This has significant benefit, as a lot of general ground about creating content for *NZ:P* has already been covered by *Quake* and *Half-Life* mapping/modding resources.

The *Nazi Zombies: Portable* makes no attempt to document a lot of these concepts as a result. There are much better, more comprehensive resources that you should follow instead. These are linked below, using Internet Archive dumps where possible.


## Links

* [The Quake Wiki](https://quakewiki.org/wiki/Main_Page): Mega-Wiki of general Quake mapping, modding, and engine information. It is recommended to only follow the resources on this page that applies to vanilla Quake engines, as opposed to *FTE*, *Quakespasm*, or *DarkPlaces*, etc. *NZ:P* is not Quake but is built from a very vanilla baseline and features many entity compatibilities.
* [*"The Whole Half-Life"* Mapping Wiki](https://twhl.info/wiki/page/category%3AGoldsource_Tutorials%2BMapping): Wiki dedicated to *GoldSource* and *Half-Life* mapping. This should be referenced to understand only basic or fundamental concepts. *NZ:P* is not built from *Half-Life* but features some basic entities from GoldSource (such as `game_counter`) and uses *Half-Life* type `30` BSP.
